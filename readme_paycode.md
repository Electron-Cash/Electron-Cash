Proof of concept of "reusable addresses proposal. https://github.com/imaginaryusername/Reusable_specs/blob/master/reusable_addresses.md

This is a CLI implementation in Electron Cash that has 3 functions:

1. generate_paycode()

This will generate a new paycode, using your wallet's receiving address 0 pubkey as the scanpubkey and receiving address 1 as the spendpubkey.  The checksum is not operable.  

2. pay_to_paycode()

This creates a raw transaction.  You need to specify both the address and the outpoint, plus the transaction amount.  WARNING: the amount to send is in full bitcoins.  

Usage:  (example for 0.1 BCH):

pay_to_paycode(0.1,0,"1NJxyu.......","0e38.....38882fb:21","paycode")

3. receive_paycode_transaction()

This takes a raw transaction and unpacks it using the paycode to generate the address.  The output is the private key.  It does not validate to see if the paycode matches.

Usage:  

receive_paycode_transaction("010000.....523300000")

This does not implement libsec256k1 as it was faster and clearer to use pure python.
